# Baseline
This will be the place to keep shared resources such as style guides, images, utility classes, formatters, types, etc ....

On a high level:

* [ute.ui.base](../ZEBASE_CTRL/src/ute/ui/base/README.md) - anything that are shared across __control libraries__.
* [nrg.base](../ZEBASE/src/nrg/base/README.md) - anything that are shared across __modules and components__.
