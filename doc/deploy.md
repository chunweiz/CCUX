# Deploy #
Eclipse will be used to deploy the CCUX application to the SAPUI5 ABAP repository. Each eclipse project refers to a particular baseline, module, control or component.

> There is always a 1 to 1 identical folder mapping between Git, Eclipse and SAPUI5 ABAP repository.

## Setting up Eclipse ##
Please make sure that you have [UI5 toolkit](prerequisites.md#markdown-header-sap-ui-development-toolkit-for-html5) installed in your Eclipse.

### File content ##
Setting relevant file content types to *Binary* prevents the [end of line marker](http://help.sap.com/saphelp_uiaddon10/helpdata/en/46/d0d54889be48d7abba0fa061c65835/content.htm) issue.

In your Eclipse, go to `Window > Preferences > Team > File Content`. The content type for the following extensions need to be set to *Binary*. If the entry is not in your Eclipse, please add it in by pressing `Add Extension...`.

Extension  | Extension | Extension | Extension | Extension | Extension | Extension     | Extension | Extension
---------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------
\*.bmp     | \*.class  |  \*.css   | \*.cur    | \*.dll    | \*.doc    | \*.eot        | \*.exe    | \*.gif
\*.htm     | \*.html   |  \*.ico   | \*.jar    | \*.jpeg   | \*.jpg    | \*.js         | \*.json   | \*.less
\*.library | \*.md     |  \*.off   | \*.pdf    | \*.png    | \*.ppt    | \*.properties | \*.so     | \*.theme
\*.tif     | \*.tiff   |  \*.ttf   | \*.txt    | \*.woff   | \*.xls    | \*.xml        | \*.zip    |

### SAP Logon ###
Eclipse reads SAP logon information from your **SAP GUI Local Configuration Files** only. If your SAP GUI is configured to read configuration files from the server only, please make a copy of the configuration files from the network and add them to your local machine as indicated below.

![SAP GUI Server Configuration Files](img/deploy.015.png)

![SAP GUI Local Configuration Files](img/deploy.016.png)

If you have local configurations files configured but still not able to see SAP Logon information in your Eclipse, please make sure that your local configuration files are populated with SAP login information.

## Grunt deploy tasks ##
Grunt deploy tasks are being used to copy the generated build folders from CCUX to the corresponding Eclipse projects. The tasks are divided into four main scenarios and are maintained at:

Scenario   | Maintained at
---------- | ---------------------------
Module     | `grunt\deploy\module.js`
Control    | `grunt\deploy\control.js`
Baseline   | `grunt\deploy\base.js`
Component  | `grunt\deploy\component.js`
Everything | `deploy.bat`

##

In order to invoke Grunt to deploy a scenario, open your command prompt and navigate to your local CCUX repository root folder where the `Gruntfile.js` resides. Depending on your scenario, type one of the following commands:

**Module**
```
#!batch
grunt --deploy=module --moduleName=<module name> --moduleFolder=<module folder> --eclipseProjectPath=<eclipse project path>
```

> where
>
> `module folder` is the baseline folder name such as ZEMOD_APP
>
> `module name` is the baseline ui5 namespace such as nrg.module.app
>
> `eclipse project path` is the project path of the Eclipse project such as C:\Users\thew\workspace\eclipse\ZEMOD_APP

**Control**
```
#!batch
grunt --deploy=control --controlFolder=<control folder> --controlName=<control name> --eclipseProjectPath=<eclipse project path>
```

> where
>
> `control folder` is the baseline folder name such as ZECTRL_MAIN
>
> `control name` is the baseline ui5 namespace such as ute.ui.main
>
> `eclipse project path` is the project path of the Eclipse project such as C:\Users\thew\workspace\eclipse\ZECTRL_MAIN

**Baseline**
```
#!batch
grunt --deploy=base --baseFolder=<base folder> --baseName=<base name> --eclipseProjectPath=<eclipse project path>
```

> where
>
> `base folder` is the baseline folder name such as ZEBASE
>
> `base name` is the baseline ui5 namespace such as nrg.base
>
> `eclipse project path` is the project path of the Eclipse project such as C:\Users\thew\workspace\eclipse\ZEBASE

**Component**
```
#!batch
grunt --deploy=component --componentName=<component name> --componentFolder=<component folder> --eclipseProjectPath=<eclipse project path>
```

> where
>
> `component folder` is the baseline folder name such as ZECMP_IC
>
> `component name` is the baseline ui5 namespace such as nrg.component.ic
>
> `eclipse project path` is the project path of the Eclipse project such as C:\Users\thew\workspace\eclipse\ZECMP_IC

##

You can deploy the entire CCUX application to the corresponding Eclipse projects by running the following batch script:

```
#!batch
deploy ECLIPSE_WORKSPACE_PATH=<eclipse workspace path>
```

> where
>
> <eclipse workspace path> is the workspace path of the Eclipse project workspace such as C:\Users\thew\workspace\eclipse

## Share CCUX application ##
To share means to connect your local Eclipse project to a particular SAPUI5 ABAP repository BSP application. You will share an Eclipse project if you need to:

* _Upload a new_ module, control, baseline or component to SAPUI5 ABAP repository.
* _Download an existing_ module, control, baseline or component from SAPUI5 ABAP repository.

Go to `File > New > Project`.

![Create Eclipse project](img/deploy.001.png)

Put your module, control, baseline or component folder name as project name. Press `Finish`.

![Eclipse project name](img/deploy.002.png)

Right-click the newly created project and choose `Team > Share Project...`.

![Share Eclipse project](img/deploy.003.png)

Choose 'SAPUI5 ABAP Repository'. Press 'Next'.

![Choose Repository](img/deploy.004.png)

Choose `SAP CMD`. Press `Next`. The SAP connection list is coming from your SAP GUI. If you are not seeing any entry, you might want to [read this up](#markdown-header-sap-logon).

![Choose SAP system](img/deploy.005.png)

Enter client `520` and your SAP logon credential to SAP CMD/520. 520 is CMD development client.

![SAP logon credential](img/deploy.006.png)

If you are uploading a new module, control, baseline or component to SAPUI5 ABAP repository, choose `Create a new BSP Application`. The name of the BSP application will be identical to the folder name of your module, control, baseline or component. Defaults the package to `ZCCUX_UI5`.

![Create BSP application](img/deploy.008.png)

If you are downloading an existing module, control, baseline or component from SAPUI5 ABAP repository, choose `Select a BSP Application`. Select the BSP application that shares the same name as the folder name of your module, control, baseline or component.

![Choose BSP application](img/deploy.007.png)

Enter transport request information. Depending on your requirements, you are given the following options:

![Choose transport request](img/deploy.009.png)

Once you have successfully shared a project, you will be able to see additional information beside the Eclipse project.

![Verify connection status](img/deploy.010.png)

***
## Retrieve CCUX application ##
To retrieve means to copy the changes from SAPUI5 ABAP repository to your local Eclipse project. You will need to [share your Eclipse project](#markdown-header-share-ccux-application) before you can retrieve the changes.

Right-click your Eclipse project. Choose `Team > Retrieve`.

![Retrieve changes](img/deploy.011.png)

Pick all the resources that you would like to retrieve. Press `Finish`.

![Select resources to retrieve](img/deploy.012.png)

Once the retrieval is completed, you can see the changes reflected in your Eclipse project.

![Verify retrieved resources](img/deploy.013.png)

***
## Submit CCUX application ##
To submit means to upload the changes from your local Eclipse project to SAPUI5 ABAP repository. You will typically do if after the [Grunt deploy](#markdown-header-grunt-deploy-tasks). You will need to [share your Eclipse project](#markdown-header-share-ccux-application) before you can submit the changes.

Right-click your Eclipse project. Choose `Team > Submit`.

![Choose a project](img/deploy.017.png)

The system complains if your local Eclipse project files are different from those in SAPUI5 ABAP repository. This usually happens after you ran the Grunt build and deploy tasks before submitting the changes. Just select all the files by pressing `CTRL + A` and press `Set Resolved`. It is okay to set everything as resolved because the latest changes are always in Git and you are running the Grunt build based on the files from Git.

![Resolve conflict](img/deploy.018.png)

This is how it looks like after you resolved the conflicts. Press `Next`.

![Resolved conflict](img/deploy.019.png)

Enter transport request information. Depending on your requirements, you are given the following options:

![Choose transport](img/deploy.020.png)

***
## Deploy ZELIB ##
ZELIB stores the OpenUI5 and any other external libraries that are used by CCUX. At the moment, there is no Grunt deploy tasks for ZELIB, hence you will need do it manually. You will still need to [share your local ZELIB Eclipse project](#markdown-header-share-ccux-application).

Below are the steps on how to submit the changes manually to SAPUI5 ABAP repository:

1. Copy the library from your local CCUX Git repository and replace the one in your local Eclipse project. Please keep in mind that `Copy + Replace` do not delete files that exist in your local Eclipse project but not in local CCUX Git repository. If you are able to identify the files, you might want to delete it manually after the replace operation. If not, it might be a good idea to perform a `Delete + Copy + Replace` operation instead.
2. [Submit the changes](#markdown-header-submit-ccux-application). It will take a while, so you might want to do this over a weekend where no one is testing CCUX in SAP.

***
## SAPUI5 ABAP repository ##
The entire CCUX application is stored under package `ZCCUX_UI5`.
